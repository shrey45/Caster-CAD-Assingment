# Basic CAD


## I created the Caster Base and Mount in Onshape

### Description

While creating the Mount and the Base, I was able to test out and execute the "Use" feature for the first time in OnShape. It was very helpful because I was able to take all of the dimensions from the Base, and applying it automatically to the mount.

## I created the Fork

### Description

The Fork was very simple to create. It was just extruding circles and rectangles, and at the end I filleted a lot of it so it looked really nice and had those rounded edges.

## I created the Tire

### Description

The Tire was the simplest part to create so far. I just had to make a small sketch, and revolve it. After that I included a fillet and I was done. There were only 3 steps to mae the Tire. I also just changed the apperance to a Grey color to make it look like a tire.

## I created the Wheel

### Description

The Wheel was probably the most complicated part to make out of all the others, but it was also not too hard. I did have some initial difficulty in creating the first sketch because I accidentally skipped a step, but I solved that problem quickly. After revolving the sketch, I had to sketch/extrude again to create th spoke and I used a pattern to duplicated that.
