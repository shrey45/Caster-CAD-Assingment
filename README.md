## Base

### Description

I created the Mount. All I had to do was make a rectangle, make some extrusions, and used a linear pattern.

### Reflection

I used the linear pattern feature for the first time. It was very simple. I also was learning how to use the "Use" feature for the next part. I made a mistake because I was using a part pattern instead of a feature pattern while using the linear pattern. I discussed with my teacher and got that fixed.

## Mount

### Description

I created the Mount. It was the same as the base, but I didn't have do do much because I transfered all the dimensions from the Base using the "Use" tool.

### Reflection

I got to test out and use the "Use" tool for the first time. I messed up because I accidentally used the entire sketch instead of just the holes. The hole thing got duplicated but I changed that after.

## Fork

### Description

The Fork was very simple to create. It was just extruding circles and rectangles, and at the end I filleted a lot of it so it looked really nice and had those rounded edges.

### Reflection

I started using the fillet tool. i had to use Google to see the fillet feature and the chamfer feature to know the difference, but I didn't make any errors.

---

## Tire

### Description

The Tire was the simplest part to create so far. I just had to make a small sketch, and revolve it. After that I included a fillet and I was done. There were only 3 steps to mae the Tire. I also just changed the apperance to a Grey color to make it look like a tire.

### Reflection

I changed the apperence for the first time. I had to use the OnShape forum to find where to change the color by using [This Link](https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/5/id-like-to-be-able-to-change-the-color-of-parts-in-my-model).

## Wheel

### Description

The Wheel was probably the most complicated part to make out of all the others, but it was also not too hard. I had to make some extrusions and some sketchs to make a really nice rim for the tire I made in the previous assignment.

### Reflection

I did have some initial difficulty in creating the first sketch because I accidentally skipped a step, but I solved that problem quickly. After revolving the sketch, I had to sketch/extrude again to create the spoke and I used a pattern to duplicated that. Next time while making a bit complex part, I have to make sure to follow the steps carefully.

## Axle-Collar-Bearings

### Description

There were a couple steps to making this part. I had to make a couple extrusions, and I had to make a few extra sketches. After I finished the Axel & Collar, I also added a small bearing to my Wheel, and I made a new Part - Big Bearing. (See 3 pictures respectively)

### Reflection

While creating the Axle & Collar, I had to use some new features. To create the screw hole I had to center the hole sketch by using the Midpoint constraint. I did have a bit of difficulty while extruding the hole because I was pressing the wrong sketch. I was able to practice using the "Use" tool again, and I feel confident in "Using" that feature:) The big bearing was too easy. Just 2 circles and an extrusion.

## Caster Assembly

### Description

In this assignment I put together all the parts I previously made. I had to use mates to put together all my parts. It was very easy. After I put together all the parts, I had to add in some screws and bolts in the holes I made and then I was done. **Caster Completed**

### Reflection

The assembly was fairly simple. I was watching the video that Dr.Shields made t know where each part goes. I had a little bit of trouble in inserting the screws, but I re-watched the video a couple times and I got it done. I had to work a bit differently than in the video while adding the pin to hold the axle, but after a few trial and error runs, I gt it. Instead of selecting the face of the axle flat part, I just selected the edge and then I made an offset for it to not poke out.

## Dorothy's Dowel Pins and Picture Frame(Extra)

### Description

For this extra assignment I was creating Dowel Pins and a Picture Frame. Thanks to the videos, it was super simple to create. In this assignment we learned how to use configurations. We were suposed to make 16 different versions of pins, with different Lengths, Diameters, and Chamfers. Instead of making the same part so many times, we used a neat tool called Configurations. We were able to create List Configurations, and we could easily switch between our 16 different configurations. We then inserted them into an assembly alog with a picture frame. I quickly made a picture frame. It took like 2 minutes. I just sketched a trapezoid, put some random dimensions(it doesn't matter how big it is) and made 2 holes. It was simple.

### Reflection

The videos made the assignment very easy, and I think that I am doig well. At the beginning of the CAD assignments, I was pretty good with Onshape as I had used it a bit before, but now I am 110% confident in using it.The frame tested my Onshape skills, and I was able to make it easily on my own. I messed up the configurations a bit in the beginning, because I had no idea how to use it, but after re-watching the videos I got it done. The assembly also got messed up a few times because I clicked on a few incorrect mate connectors, so I slowed down and tried to click them more carefully.
