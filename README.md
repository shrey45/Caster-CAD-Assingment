Making the Caster in OnShape

## Base

### Description

I created the Mount. All I had to do was make a rectangle, make some extrusions, and used a linear pattern.

### Reflection

I used the linear pattern feature for the first time. It was very simple. I also was learning how to use the "Use" feature for the next part. I made a mistake because I was using a part pattern instead of a feature pattern while using the linear pattern. I discussed with my teacher and got that fixed.

## Mount

### Description

I created the Mount. It was the same as the base, but I didn't have do do much because I transfered all the dimensions from the Base using the "Use" tool.

### Reflection

I got to test out and use the "Use" tool for the first time. I messed up because I accidentally used the entire sketch instead of just the holes. The hole thing got duplicated but I changed that after.

## Fork

### Description

The Fork was very simple to create. It was just extruding circles and rectangles, and at the end I filleted a lot of it so it looked really nice and had those rounded edges.

### Reflection

I started using the fillet tool. i had to use Google to see the fillet feature and the chamfer feature to know the difference, but I didn't make any errors.

## Tire

### Description

The Tire was the simplest part to create so far. I just had to make a small sketch, and revolve it. After that I included a fillet and I was done. There were only 3 steps to mae the Tire. I also just changed the apperance to a Grey color to make it look like a tire.

### Reflection

I changed the apperence for the first time. I had to use the OnShape forum to find where to change the color by using [This Link](https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/5/id-like-to-be-able-to-change-the-color-of-parts-in-my-model).

## Wheel

### Description

The Wheel was probably the most complicated part to make out of all the others, but it was also not too hard. I had to make some extrusions and some sketchs to make a really nice rim for the tire I made in the previous assignment.

### Reflection

I did have some initial difficulty in creating the first sketch because I accidentally skipped a step, but I solved that problem quickly. After revolving the sketch, I had to sketch/extrude again to create the spoke and I used a pattern to duplicated that. Next time while making a bit complex part, I have to make sure to follow the steps carefully.
